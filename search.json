Good data visualisation requires appreciation and careful consideration of the technical aspects of data presentation. But it also involves a creative element. Authorial choices are made about the ‚Äústory‚Äù we want to tell, and design decisions are driven by the need to convey that story most effectively to our audience. Software systems use default settings for most graphical elements. However, each visualisation has its own story to tell, and so we must actively consider and choose settings for the visualisation we are building. In this talk, Nicola will showcase why you should visualise data, present some guidelines for making more effective charts, before discussing examples of good and not so good charts."

Rather, the availability and rapidly growing capabilities of these tools have exposed weaknesses in learning design and assessment that educators have been ignoring for a while.\nIn this talk, I will draw on my experience in teaching psychology students about computational reproducibility and the value of R-based data workflows. I will argue for the need to rethink what learning to learn looks like and talk about how we might reframe assessment as the process of gathering evidence that learning has occurred.\nThere is no avoiding the fact that students now need to learn how to learn alongside Generative AI. Data science educators can help them by designing learning experiences that build self-regulated learning skills and normalise what real learning feels like."

    "text": "Harriet Mason\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualising Uncertainty with ggdibbler\n\n\nAdding uncertainty representation in a data visualisation can help in decision-making. There is an existing wealth of software designed to visualise uncertainty as a distribution or probability. These visualisations are excellent for helping understand the uncertainty in our data, but they may not be effective at incorporating uncertainty to prevent false conclusions. Successfully preventing false conclusions requires us to communicate the estimate and its error as a single ‚Äúvalidity of signal‚Äù variable, and doing so proves to be difficult with current methods. In this talk, we introduce ggdibbler, a ggplot extension that makes it easier to visualise uncertainty in plots for the purposes of preventing these ‚Äúfalse signals‚Äù. We illustrate how ggdibbler can be seamlessly integrated into existing visualisation workflows and highlight the effect of these changes by showing the alternative visualisations ggdibbler produces for a choropleth map."

Formal code review poses practical challenges, including the need for time, expertise, and a supportive environment, particularly given the complexity of analyses and the diverse skills required. To address these challenges, the Australia-Aotearoa Consortium for Epidemic Forecasting & Analytics (ACEFA) is piloting a peer code review program among its members, who produce short-term epidemic forecasts for Australia and New Zealand. The aims are to verify that models correctly implement their documented methods, identify areas for improvement, promote good coding practices, and familiarize researchers with code review as a valuable tool for scientific rigor. The program‚Äôs effectiveness will be evaluated through participant surveys, with the intent of refining the process and sharing it as a model for others in the research community."

    "text": "Tyler Reysenbach\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding a new data team ‚Äì balancing quick wins and long term investments\n\n\nEvery new data team faces the same dilemma: stakeholders expect immediate results while the team knows that achieving long-term impact needs investment in its capabilities. Should they build that reporting dashboard everyone‚Äôs asking for, or spend three months building a new dataset that could inform future priorities? If they choose the quick win, the team risks being pigeonholed into a reporting team, unable to focus on longer-term projects, with more and more regular products requiring maintenance. Focus on building capacity, and the team might lose organisational support before they can prove their value, limiting their impact before they could even get going.\nDrawing on experience from working in the Central Analytics Hub at the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet during the pandemic and working to help address capability gaps to better inform migration policy reform, this talk will explore the practical realities of navigating these tensions. I‚Äôll share stories from both experiences‚Äîfrom delivering urgent daily briefings while building the necessary capability to pivot to changing priorities, to establishing credibility while building the infrastructure needed to inform pressing policy priorities.\nThis talk will offer honest reflections on the messy reality of building data teams in government, providing practical insights for anyone wrestling with similar challenges."

I joined the study team last year and have been redeveloping the data pipeline to be more transparent, reproducible, and easier to maintain. My original plan was to incorporate best practices, such as using targets and renv for ensuring reproducibility and pointblank and testthat for validation and testing, as well as writing nice code.\nIt was a good plan, but it didn‚Äôt fully consider the people in the study team. Being able to run code from start to finish without error might be reproducible in a technical sense, but is someone actually reproducing it if they don‚Äôt understand what the code is doing? Code is only reproducible so long as it‚Äôs maintainable. Since I‚Äôm the only experienced R-user (for now), each additional package I use is a package someone else has to understand and runs the risk of making the code less reproducible.\nIn this session I‚Äôll be talking about:\n\nthe Mayi Kuwayu Study and team context\ndevelopment of the data pipeline\nthe role people played in design decisions\nusing the development as an opportunity to upskill my team"
